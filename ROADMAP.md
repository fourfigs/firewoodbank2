**Repo**: https://github.com/fourfigs/firewoodbank2  
**Status**: 🟢 Stage 12 Complete - All roadmap stages implemented  
**Target**: Windows Desktop → Multi-platform sync-ready app

## 🎯 PROJECT GOALS

- Windows desktop-first Tauri 2 app for Firewood Bank operations

## 📋 DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW (MANDATORY - Follow Exactly)

1️⃣ BEFORE EACH STAGE:
git checkout -b stage-X-[name]

Paste OVERALL SYSTEM PROMPT in Cursor (pinned)
2️⃣ IMPLEMENTATION:

Model proposes file changes

Copy-paste exact diffs

npm install && tauri dev

3️⃣ VERIFY:

Check "What you should see" matches
Review login screen “Revision checklist” for per-stage behaviors to smoke-test

Test all new UI flows

4️⃣ COMMIT:
git add . && git commit -m "feat(stage-X): [name]"
git push origin stage-X-[name]

## 🚀 STAGES (12 total - Current progress tracked here)

### 🟡 **Stage 0: Schema Design** (Planning)

✅ Create this Roadmap.md + commit
✅ Design sync-ready schema from PDFs
✅ Output: Rust structs + TS DTOs
What you see: Schema definitions ready

### ✅ **Stage 1: Tauri + React Skeleton**

Scaffold Tauri 2 Windows app + React nav shell
Add ping command (test Rust↔React bridge)
What you see: Desktop window w/ Dashboard/Clients/Inventory nav
Branch: stage-1-skeleton

### ✅ **Stage 2: SQLite + Sync Tables**

SQLite migrations for ALL entities w/ sync fields
Rust CRUD for Client/InventoryItem
Tauri commands: createClient/listClients/etc
What you see: DB connection + test commands work
Branch: stage-2-db

### ✅ **Stage 3: Clients Module**

Client list + onboard form aligned to PDFs
Create + approval status + gate combo capture
Placeholder delivery metrics
What you see: Add/edit clients w/ full form
Branch: stage-3-clients

### ✅ **Stage 4: Inventory Module**

chainsaws/bar oil/gas/files/helmets etc + thresholds
Below-threshold warnings + auto order messages
CRUD + "needs restock" view
What you see: Inventory list w/ low-stock alerts
Branch: stage-4-inventory

### 🟢 **Stage 5: Work Orders + Deliveries**

Full Order.pdf form → WorkOrder entity
Auto-create DeliveryEvent on schedule
Client→WorkOrder linking
What you see: Create work orders from clients
Branch: stage-5-workorders

### ✅ **Stage 5.1: Tuning Forms & Access**

Role-based gating for client/workorder/inventory creation
HIPAA-aware PII masking (only admins + certified leads; drivers get address/phone for assigned work)
Volunteer/driver limited views; mileage required to close work orders
Mailer list view; + toggles and icon updates; login role/username flow
What you see: Forms gated by role, PII masked per policy, mileage field on work orders
Branch: stage-5.1-tuningForms
Sub-stages to close gaps:

- 5.1a: Driver delivery-only view (address/contact for assigned deliveries; strip non-delivery workorder PII)
- 5.1b: Persist assignments/mileage/availability/vehicle in backend schema + commands
- 5.1c: Server-side PII enforcement (role checks, driver-limited payloads, audit logging hooks; town and mileage initially derived from client address)
- 5.1d: Volunteer/driver hours + wood-credit calc wired to persisted events (0.75 minutes/mile; delivery assignments mirrored into delivery_events)
- Closing a work order to “completed” requires mileage and records the lead/admin who closed it
- Slice: Audit log persisted (audit_logs table) and MOTD surfaced on login newest→oldest
- ✅ Completed slices:
  - ✅ Client/Inventory edit/delete UI (Stage 2) - COMPLETE
  - ✅ Full onboarding fields + client edit flow (Stage 3) - COMPLETE (client_title is old/unused and should be removed)
  - ✅ "Needs restock" filter + auto-order messaging (Stage 4) - COMPLETE
  - ✅ User CRUD (availability/vehicle/DL/HIPAA) in Worker Directory (Stage 5.1b) - COMPLETE
  - ✅ Audit log viewer/export (Stage 5.1c / 5.4) - COMPLETE (Reports tab with filtering)
  - Note: Town derivation is NOT needed (was an old mistake) - all contact blocks use standard form names

### ✅ Stage Prompts Reference (used and implemented across stages 0–5)

- Stage 0 prompt: Windows desktop–first Tauri 2 + React + TypeScript + SQLite; sync-ready schema/DTOs for User, Client, InventoryItem, WorkOrder, DeliveryEvent, Invoice, MOTD, ChangeRequest; UUID + audit/sync fields; infer fields from Onboard/Order/Invoice; output Rust/SQL + TS DTOs; call out missing/ambiguous.
- Stage 1 prompt: Scaffold Tauri 2 app (Windows), React+TS frontend, nav shell (Dashboard, Clients, Inventory, Work Orders, Admin, Driver placeholder), Tauri `ping` command and React caller; include run commands.
- Stage 2 prompt: Add SQLite/migrations for all entities with sync fields; Rust CRUD for Client/Inventory; Tauri commands create/update/list for both; handle createdAt/updatedAt/isDeleted/UUID.
- Stage 3 prompt: Clients module with search/filter, detail/edit with all onboard fields (title, onboarding date, addresses, phones, email, how heard, referring agency, approvalStatus+denialReason, gateCombo, notes). Note: numeric client identifiers (formerly `client_number`) were removed from the schema and UI.
- Stage 4 prompt: Inventory module with list/detail, CRUD for operational items, fields (name, category, currentQuantity, unit, reorderThreshold, isActive), derived belowThreshold + orderMessage, “Needs restock” view for dashboard/admin.
- Stage 5 prompt: Work Orders + DeliveryEvents with full Order fields, client snapshot/link, addresses/directions/gate combo/heat sources/notes/dateOfOnboarding/scheduledDate/status; DeliveryEvent tied to WorkOrder (type/title/notes/start/end/colorCode); create WorkOrder from Client and auto-create DeliveryEvent when scheduled.

### ✅ **Stage 5.2: Work Order and Intake Hardening**

Tighten intake UX/validation before Stage 6:

- ✅ Split client name into first/last; numeric client identifiers (formerly auto-generated `client_number`) have been removed
- ✅ Client edit locked to admin/lead (canManage gate)
- ✅ Enforce required: name, address, at least one contact (phone/email/other+specify)
- ✅ Format phone `(###) ###-####` with validation
- ✅ City init-cap formatting
- ✅ State 2-letter uppercase validation
- ✅ ZIP validation `#####` or `#####-####`
- ✅ Wood size dropdown (12/14/16/Other + specify inches integer) and delivery size (1 cord / 1/3 cord / other numeric), carry both on work orders
- ✅ Inventory impact: reserve wood on schedule/in-progress and deduct on completed; release on cancel (reserved_quantity tracking)
- ✅ Driver assignment dropdown (licensed drivers from DB only - DL flag required)
- ✅ Driver availability drives schedule choices (weekly schedule)
- ✅ Status/mileage editable only by lead/admin (driver can enter mileage and mark delivered pending approval)
- ✅ Label work orders with creator display name (not username)
- ✅ Work orders entered by staff and admin only (UI + backend gate)
- ✅ Drivers can add up to four workers/helpers on a delivery (assignees_json)
- ✅ All clients can be workers, all workers can be driver/hipaa/working vehicle flagged, only leads/admins get PII unfiltered, and drivers only see the name, address, and contact info
  What you see: Validated intake forms, wood/delivery sizes, inventory reservations, driver assignments with availability
  Branch: stage-5.2-intake

### ✅ **Stage 5.3: Worker Directory**

Admin/Lead-only Worker Directory tab:

- ✅ List all workers with name, phone, availability, DL status, vehicle, HIPAA certification

  What you see: Worker Directory tab with list and edit profile
  Branch: stage-5.3-workers

### ✅ **Stage 5.4: Reports / Audit Log Viewer**

Admin/Lead-only Reports tab for viewing audit logs:

- ✅ Reports tab in navigation (gated to admin/lead roles)
- ✅ Audit log viewer displaying: timestamp, event, role, actor
- ✅ Time-based filtering: Day, 7 Days, Current Month, Year, All Time
- ✅ Table view with sorting
- ✅ Backend: `list_audit_logs` Tauri command with date filtering
  What you see: Reports tab with filterable audit log table
  Branch: stage-5.4-reports

### ✅ **Stage 6: Login + Dashboard + Calendar**

Split/unsplit wood summary
2-weeks-at-glance + monthly calendar (color-coded)
Upcoming list + MOTD
Admin: availability + low inventory cards
Dashboard MOTD panel uses the scrollable notes area (like login checklist); newest messages push older down
